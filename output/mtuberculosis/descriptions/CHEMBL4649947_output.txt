**1. Assay description**  
The functional assay evaluates inhibition of Aspartate-tRNA ligase (AspRS-1) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain ATCC 25618 / H37Rv. Compounds were tested in a whole-cell format using a 384-well plate with log-phase bacteria cultured in standard Middlebrook medium at 37 °C. The read‑out is the percent effect on protein synthesis measured by incorporation of a radiolabel or fluorescence reporter, normalized to vehicle control. Test concentrations ranged from 1 uM to 10 uM, and reactions were incubated for 24 h before quantification under standard assay conditions to ensure reproducibility.  

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Results are expressed as percent effect (PERCENTEFFECT), where positive values indicate inhibition of AspRS‑1 activity relative to a vehicle control. Activity values are calculated by normalizing compound‑treated wells to the mean of DMSO controls, followed by subtraction from 100 % and conversion to a signed value. The direction of activity is +1, as higher percent inhibition reflects greater potency. Reference thresholds commonly applied in this dataset consider >=10 % inhibition as a primary hit. Negative values represent apparent activation or assay noise and are treated as inactive. The assay includes triplicate wells and a positive control inhibitor for quality assurance.  

**3. Results and insights**  
The activity distribution (n = 8,841) is centered near zero, with a mean of 0.205 % and median of -0.28 %. The 1st percentile ranges -8.344 % while the 99th percentile reaches 12.91 %. Only a small subset of compounds exceeds the 10 % inhibition threshold, indicating limited active hits within this library. The assay demonstrates high reproducibility, with low standard deviation across replicates. Data quality is supported by the large sample size and consistent negative control values. Curators note that most entries are low-activity, which is typical for whole-cell AspRS-1 assays and highlights the need for secondary validation of promising candidates.
