**1. Assay description**  
The assay is a functional, in‑vitro screen of Plasmodium falciparum NF54 parasites cultured within human erythrocytes. Parasites constitutively express the nanoluciferase reporter (NanoGlo). Compounds from the MMV Hit Generation Library 1 (HGL1) were tested at a single concentration of 2 µM for 72 h. Luminescence was measured on a plate reader and expressed as a percentage relative to DMSO‑treated controls, providing a quantitative read‑out of parasite viability. Temperature was maintained at 37 °C with 5 % CO₂. The assay format is a cell‑based inhibition assay employing a luminescent detection method.

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Percent inhibition is calculated by normalizing parasite luminescence to the mean of DMSO wells. Positive values indicate reduction of parasite growth, whereas negative values represent increased luminescence relative to control, interpreted as stimulation or assay noise. The direction of activity is +1. Known antimalarials (e.g., chloroquine, artemisinin) served as positive controls, achieving >90 % inhibition, while DMSO constituted the negative baseline. Thresholds for hit selection were set at ≥20 % inhibition, with further confirmation in dose‑response assays. Data were log‑normalized, and outliers exceeding 3 SD from the mean were excluded from statistical analyses.

**3. Results and insights**  
Across 147 592 activity measurements for 147 430 compounds, the distribution centers near zero inhibition: mean –2.8 %, median –5.0 %, 25th percentile –10.0 %, and 75th percentile 1.0 %. The highest observed inhibition was 39 %, indicating a limited pool of active hits. The low mean and narrow variance reflect a low hit rate typical of primary screens, underscoring the necessity of orthogonal assays for confirmation. Notably, a small subset exceeded the 20 % threshold, representing promising candidates for secondary evaluation. Data quality was robust, with minimal missing values (“nan” not reported) and reproducible control performance.
