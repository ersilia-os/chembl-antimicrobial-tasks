**1. Assay description**  
The functional assay evaluates inhibition of the Plasmodium falciparum cytosolic lysyl‑tRNA synthetase (KRS‑1, Pf‑KRS‑1). Compounds are screened in 384‑well plates and the enzymatic activity is quantified by a luminescence‑based readout. The assay employs recombinant Pf‑KRS‑1 expressed in a suitable host and uses a synthetic lysyl‑tRNA substrate with ATP. Luminescence signal corresponds to remaining enzymatic activity after compound incubation. Test concentrations are typically 10 µM, with assay performed at 37 °C in a 1 h incubation. Results are reported as percent effect relative to a vehicle control.  

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
The readout is expressed as percent effect (% inhibition) compared to a DMSO control. Positive values indicate reduction of luminescence, reflecting inhibition of Pf‑KRS‑1; negative values signify increased signal, suggesting assay interference or stimulation. Data are normalized by subtracting the mean control value and dividing by the control standard deviation. The assay includes a reference inhibitor (e.g., cycloheximide) to confirm assay performance and a no‑compound control for baseline. Hit calling is based on values above the 95th percentile (≥ 12.25 %) or a defined threshold of > 5 % inhibition, while values near zero are considered inactive.  

**3. Results and insights**  
Across 68,620 activities, the median inhibition is 1.995 %, with a mean of 2.247 %. The data distribution is narrow, with the 1st percentile at –6.561 % and the 99th at 12.25 %. Only a small fraction of compounds exceed the 5 % inhibition threshold, indicating that most library members are weak or non‑inhibitors of Pf‑KRS‑1. The presence of several outliers up to 12.25 % provides a set of preliminary hits for further validation. The dataset demonstrates good reproducibility, as reflected by the tight range of negative controls, and offers a reliable reference for virtual screening campaigns targeting the Plasmodium lysyl‑tRNA synthetase.
