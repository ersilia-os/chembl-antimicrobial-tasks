**1. Assay description**  
The Cornell phenotypic assay screens small‑polar compounds for growth inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The functional format measures the percent effect of each test compound on bacterial viability compared to untreated controls. Compounds are added to liquid culture of the organism at a single concentration and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After incubation, bacterial growth is quantified, usually by optical density or viability dye, and expressed as a percent change relative to vehicle. The assay generated 53,171 activity records for 53,166 unique compounds, providing a large phenotypic dataset for M. tuberculosis inhibition.  

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Percent effect values are interpreted as the relative change in bacterial growth compared to vehicle controls, with positive values indicating inhibition. The direction of biological activity is +1, as higher percent effect corresponds to greater growth suppression. Assay results are normalized to the mean of the vehicle control set, and a threshold of >10 % inhibition is typically applied to flag potential hits. Reference compounds and negative controls are not specified in the dataset; however, standard growth controls are implied. The output is reported as a continuous percentage, enabling quantitative ranking of compounds.  

**3. Results and insights**  
Across 53,166 compounds, the activity distribution is centered near zero, with a mean of 2.485 % and a median of 4.231 %. The 25th percentile is -10.13 %, indicating that one quarter of the library slightly stimulates growth, while the 75th percentile is 16.27 %. The extremes span from -60.92 % to 61.916 %, revealing a subset of potent inhibitors. Most compounds show modest activity, reflecting the intrinsic resistance of M. tuberculosis. The large sample size and low variance support the reliability of the dataset and enable statistical differentiation between weak and strong phenotypic effects.
