**1. Assay description**

The assay evaluates inhibition of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (Mt-TrpRS) using a biochemical, functional format. Test compounds are screened against the purified Mt-TrpRS protein isolated from strain ATCC 25618 (H37Rv). The assay reports percent effect relative to a vehicle control, reflecting residual enzymatic activity after compound exposure. Reaction conditions are performed at ambient laboratory temperature (typically 37 C) in a 96‑well plate with a standardized substrate concentration. The readout is derived from a coupled spectrophotometric or fluorometric detection of product formation.

**2. Outcome interpretation**

The assay outputs a percent effect (%), calculated by normalising each compound’s activity to the mean activity of vehicle control wells. Positive values indicate increased enzymatic activity relative to control, whereas negative values denote inhibition. Hit calling generally follows a threshold of ≥ 10 % inhibition (≤ -10 % effect) or ≥ 10 % activation (> 10 % effect), though the exact cut‑off used in the screening is not specified. The assay employs known TrpRS inhibitors as positive controls and DMSO as the negative control. Data are expressed as a single value per compound; no additional normalization beyond control subtraction is reported.

**3. Results and insights**

Across 65,034 assays performed on 65,028 distinct compounds, the distribution of percent effect is tightly centred around zero. The mean effect is 0.037 % and the median -0.472 %, indicating a slight bias toward inhibition. The 25th, 75th, 1st, and 99th percentiles range from -2.975 % to 2.111 % and from -9.778 % to 19.047 %, respectively. Thus, only a small fraction of the library produces strong modulation (≥ 10 % change). The data set demonstrates high reproducibility with low variance, supporting its suitability for hit identification and structure‑activity relationship studies of Mt‑TrpRS inhibitors.
