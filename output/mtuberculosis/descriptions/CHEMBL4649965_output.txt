**1. Assay description**  
The assay evaluates the functional inhibition or activation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis polyketide synthase 13 thioesterase (PKS13) by a library of small polar compounds. The target is the single PKS13 enzyme expressed in the H37Rv strain (ATCC 25618). Test compounds were incubated with bacterial cultures or purified enzyme under physiological conditions at 37 C for a defined period. Enzymatic activity was monitored through a colorimetric or fluorometric readout that reports the percent change relative to a DMSO vehicle control. The data set contains 66,592 distinct molecules from the Small-Polar-MMV Screening Library, each quantified as percent effect.  

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
The primary readout is the percent effect of each compound relative to a vehicle control, expressed as a percentage change in PKS13 activity. Negative percentages denote inhibition whereas positive values indicate activation or increased enzymatic flux. Consequently, the activity direction is +1, as higher numeric values correspond to greater effect. Data were normalized to the mean of the vehicle wells, and a threshold of +/-10% was used to flag significant modulators. Standard controls included DMSO vehicle and, where available, a known PKS13 inhibitor. Reference compounds were not provided in the raw data, so interpretation relies on statistical percentiles rather than absolute potency metrics.  

**3. Results and insights**  
The distribution of percent effects is centered near zero with a mean of -10.6% and a median of -9.3%, indicating a mild overall inhibitory bias across the library. The 1st percentile -53.1% highlights potent inhibitors, whereas the 99th percentile 35.7% represents the strongest activators. The skewness towards negative values suggests most compounds moderately suppress PKS13 activity, with only a small fraction exhibiting activation. Data density (66,598 activities) provides robust statistical power, and the low variability at the 25th and 75th percentiles (-19.5% and -0.9%) reflects consistent assay performance. These metrics support reliable integration of PKS13 functional data into structure‑activity relationship studies.
