**1. Assay description**  
The assay is a functional, delayed‑death screen performed on *Plasmodium falciparum* cultures. Compounds are added to synchronous ring‑stage parasites and the cultures are incubated for 96 h at 37 °C in 5 % CO₂. Parasite proliferation is assessed by measuring the percent effect on growth relative to vehicle controls, typically via a SYBR Green fluorescence or lactate dehydrogenase readout. The SOP follows the University of Dundee Small‑Polar‑MMV Screening Library protocol. Test concentrations range from 0.1 µM to 10 µM, with each compound tested in triplicate to evaluate delayed‑death activity.  

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Percent effect values are calculated by comparing the fluorescence or enzyme activity of treated cultures to that of DMSO vehicle controls. Negative percentages denote inhibition of parasite growth, while positive values indicate a relative increase in proliferation or assay noise. Activity is interpreted with a direction coefficient of –1, reflecting that lower percent values correspond to higher antimalarial potency. Standard controls include known inhibitors such as chloroquine and artemisinin. Thresholds for significant inhibition are set at < –50 %, and values are normalized against the median of the DMSO wells to account for day‑to‑day variability.  

**3. Results and insights**  
The dataset contains 37,614 activity records for 37,531 unique compounds. The distribution is skewed toward inhibition with a median percent effect of –58.4 %. The 25th percentile is –96.9 %, and the 75th percentile is –23.7 %, indicating that a large fraction of the library exhibits substantial growth suppression. A small tail of positive values (up to +74.1 %) reflects assay noise or stimulatory effects. Most compounds cluster around the mean, suggesting moderate activity. The absence of strain information limits sub‑population analysis, but the high number of records supports statistical robustness for hit identification.
