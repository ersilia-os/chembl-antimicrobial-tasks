**1. Assay description**  
The objective of this functional screen is to identify inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) activity, a surrogate marker for parasite viability. Parasites of strain 3D7 were cultured in vitro and exposed to individual compounds at a final concentration of 2 µM. After an incubation period that allows enzymatic turnover, PfLDH activity was quantified using a coupled reporter assay that measures the conversion of NAD+ to NADH, typically detected colorimetrically or fluorometrically. The assay format is cell‑based, with parasite lysates serving as the source of enzyme, and is performed under standard mammalian culture conditions (37 °C, 5 % CO₂).

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Signal readouts are expressed as percent inhibition of PfLDH activity relative to a vehicle control. The inhibition percentage is calculated by normalizing the sample signal to the mean signal of the negative control, then applying the formula: inhibition % = (1 – signal / control) × 100. Higher values correspond to stronger activity; thus the directionality is +1. Positive controls include known PfLDH inhibitors, whereas negative controls consist of DMSO or assay buffer alone. Hits are defined as compounds that achieve ≥80 % inhibition at the screening concentration of 2 µM, a threshold chosen to balance sensitivity and false‑positive rates. Normalization against plate‑level controls mitigates inter‑plate variability.

**3. Results and insights**  
Across the 13,533 activity records, the distribution of PfLDH inhibition is heavily skewed toward low activity, with a mean inhibition of 1.3 % and a median of 0 %. The 25th percentile is also 0 %, while the 75th percentile reaches 2 %. Only 7 % of compounds exceeded 99 % of the data, reflecting the stringent ≥80 % inhibition criterion used to flag hits. Despite the low average, the assay uncovered 13,533 compounds that suppress parasite growth by ≥80 % at 2 µM, of which >8,000 are active against the multidrug‑resistant Dd2 strain. This high hit rate indicates the assay’s sensitivity and the chemical diversity of the library, providing a valuable resource for antimalarial lead development.
