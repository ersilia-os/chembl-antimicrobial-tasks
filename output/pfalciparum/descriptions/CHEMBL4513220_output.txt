**1. Assay description**  
The functional screen evaluates the inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stage (ABS) growth by compounds at a single concentration of 5 µM. Parasites were cultured from the Dd2 strain and exposed to test molecules in vitro for a defined period (typically 48–72 h) at 37 °C under 5 % O₂, 5 % CO₂. Growth was quantified by measuring parasitemia through a colorimetric or fluorescent readout that counts parasitized erythrocytes relative to total cells. The assay is designed to identify multistage‑active antimalarials and is performed in a high‑throughput format compatible with large chemical libraries.

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Activity is expressed as percent inhibition of parasite growth relative to a vehicle control; higher positive values correspond to stronger inhibition (direction +1). The assay includes DMSO as the negative control and a known antimalarial (e.g., chloroquine) as the positive control to set a baseline. Readouts are normalized against the mean control value, and compounds producing >30 % inhibition are typically considered hits. Values below zero indicate an increase in parasitemia versus control. The data are reported in a single‑point format, enabling rapid triage of promising leads.

**3. Results and insights**  
Across 64 768 compounds, 64 811 activity measurements were obtained. The distribution is heavily skewed toward negative values, with a median of –52.5 % and 75th percentile at –17.9 %. Only a minority of molecules exceed the 30 % inhibition threshold, the highest observed activity being 76.4 %. This suggests that most library members either lack activity or may slightly promote parasite growth at 5 µM. The large dataset and consistent assay conditions provide a robust reference for identifying potent multistage antimalarials and underscore the importance of secondary screening for confirmatory potency.
