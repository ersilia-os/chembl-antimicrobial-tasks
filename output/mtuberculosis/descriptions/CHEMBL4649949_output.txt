**1. Assay description**  
The assay is a phenotypic growth inhibition study of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* performed in 7H9 medium supplemented with glucose and Tyloxapol. Cultures were inoculated and incubated for 3 days, typically at 37 °C, in 96‑well plates. Test compounds were added at a single concentration series to evaluate dose‑dependent effects on bacterial proliferation. The primary read‑out is the IC50 value, defined as the concentration required to reduce bacterial growth by 50 % compared with untreated controls. The assay employs an optical or viability‑based detection method, although the exact read‑out technique is not specified in the dataset. The biological target is unchecked, reflecting the phenotypic nature of the screening.

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Outputs are quantified as IC50 values in umol.L‑1. Lower IC50 values indicate stronger growth inhibition, thus the directionality is −1. Results are normalized to a vehicle (DMSO) control, and percent inhibition is calculated relative to untreated growth. A threshold of 50 % inhibition is used to define active compounds. Positive control activity is not reported, but standard reference compounds may be included in the assay plate. Data normalization includes baseline correction and log‑transformation of concentrations before IC50 determination. The assay is considered high‑throughput functional, generating one activity value per compound.

**3. Results and insights**  
The assay screened 2,468 distinct compounds, producing a single IC50 per entry. The activity distribution is right‑skewed: the first percentile is 2.669 uM, median 129.938 uM, and the 99th percentile 501.187 uM. Mean activity is 184.002 uM, with a 75th percentile of 273.874 uM. Most molecules exhibit moderate to weak activity (>100 uM), whereas a minority show potent inhibition (<10 uM). Data quality appears high with consistent statistics and a large compound set, supporting robust integration. The unchecked target status underscores the phenotypic assay’s emphasis on whole‑cell growth inhibition rather than specific molecular binding.
