**1. Assay description**

The assay evaluates the effect of small molecules on Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite viability using a functional, organism‑based screening format. Conducted with the University of Dundee Small‑Polar‑MMV library, the test measures percent change in sporozoite survival relative to a vehicle control. Compounds are incubated with cultured sporozoites at a single concentration, then viability is assessed after a defined incubation period (temperature and duration not specified). Detection is performed by a viability readout that yields a percent effect, expressed in percent units. The assay employs a high‑throughput format suitable for large compound libraries.

**2. Outcome interpretation**

Data are expressed as percent effect, where a higher positive value indicates a greater reduction in sporozoite viability. Activity is calculated relative to vehicle controls and normalized to percent of control, with a threshold of ≥20 % considered active. Positive controls (known antimalarial) and negative controls (DMSO) were included, although specific reference compounds are not reported. The assay reports a range of activities from –41.8 % to +63.9 %, with most values clustered near zero, reflecting limited activity for the majority of library members.

**3. Results and insights**

Analysis of 36,096 activities from 33,698 compounds shows a highly skewed distribution: the median effect is 0.32 %, and the 75th percentile is 6.68 %. Only 1 % of the library (percentile 99) achieves effects above 63.9 %, indicating a small subset of potent inhibitors. The negative tail (down to –41.8 %) suggests some compounds may enhance sporozoite viability or cause assay artefacts. Data quality appears robust given the large dataset, yet strain information is missing and assay conditions are not fully detailed. Curators should verify that the percent effect values are correctly mapped to the organism target and that normalization to controls is consistently applied.
