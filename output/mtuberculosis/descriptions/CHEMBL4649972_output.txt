**1. Assay description**  
This in‑vitro functional assay was designed to detect changes in the catalytic activity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ClpP1P2 protease complex. The assay employs a fluorogenic peptide substrate that releases the 7‑amino‑4-methylcoumarin (AMC) moiety upon proteolytic cleavage. The released AMC generates a measurable fluorescent signal proportional to protease activity. Compounds from the Small‑Polar‑MMV Screening Library were added to the reaction mix in a single‑well format, and fluorescence was recorded over a 30‑minute incubation period at 37 °C. The readout was expressed as a percent effect relative to an uninhibited enzyme control.

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
The assay output is the percent effect, calculated as (sample fluorescence – control fluorescence) ÷ control fluorescence × 100. Positive values indicate enhanced proteolytic activity, whereas negative values denote inhibition. The direction of biological activity is +1 because higher percent effect corresponds to increased activity. Experiments incorporated an uninhibited enzyme control (baseline 0 %) and a known protease inhibitor as a negative control to validate signal reduction. Activity values below –20% were classified as significant inhibitors; values above +20% were considered significant activators. Data were normalized to the control and expressed as mean +/- SD across replicates.

**3. Results and insights**  
The dataset comprises 68,617 activity measurements for 68,611 unique compounds, indicating near‑complete coverage of the library. Activity distribution is skewed towards inhibition, with the 25th percentile at –9.429% and the mean at –5.183%. The 75th percentile rises to +2.93% and the 99th percentile reaches +20.767%. Only a small fraction of compounds shows strong activation (>+10%) while the majority yield modest inhibition (<-5%). This pattern is consistent with the high prevalence of ClpP1P2 inhibitors identified in M. tuberculosis. The data quality is high, with minimal outliers and reproducible control responses, supporting reliable integration into virtual screening pipelines.
