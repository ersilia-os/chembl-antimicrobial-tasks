**1. Assay description**  
This functional assay evaluates inhibition of the MtCoaBC enzyme in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strain ATCC 25618 (H37Rv). Cultures were grown in 96‑well plates and treated with compounds from a small‑polar screening library. After incubation at 37°C for 48 h, bacterial growth was quantified by the Biomol Green reagent, measuring optical density at 650 nm. The assay records percent effect relative to untreated controls. Experiments were performed in duplicate, with incubation temperature maintained at 37°C and final compound concentrations ranging from 0.1 uM to 100 uM, depending on the library dilution series.

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Percent effect values are derived by normalizing the OD650 signal of each well to the mean OD650 of DMSO‑treated controls, expressed as a percentage. Positive values indicate growth relative to control, whereas negative values signify growth inhibition. The assay is scored with a negative direction of activity (-1), because lower percent effect corresponds to stronger inhibitory activity. Data were normalized to 0 % for complete inhibition and 100 % for full growth. Positive control wells containing no compound establish the baseline; negative controls with known CoaBC inhibitors confirm assay responsiveness. Results below -10 % are considered significant inhibition, while values near zero are interpreted as inactive.

**3. Results and insights**  
The assay dataset comprises 67,382 activities for 66,942 compounds. Distribution analysis reveals a narrow central peak around 1‑2 % effect, with the 25th percentile at -1.196 % and the 75th percentile at 4.893 %. Negative values indicate growth inhibition, and the most potent compounds produce effects down to -28.038 %, whereas the strongest growth stimulants reach 17.76 %. The data quality is high, with duplicate measurements and clear control separation. No reference compound values are reported. This assay enables identification of both inhibitors and weak activators of MtCoaBC, providing a valuable resource for structure‑activity relationship studies in drug discovery against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.
