**1. Assay description**  
The assay evaluates the ability of small molecules to inhibit the growth of *Plasmodium falciparum* parasites by targeting the apicoplast, a plastid organelle essential for parasite survival. The experiment is a quantitative high‑throughput screening (qHTS) performed in a 384‑well format. Parasites are exposed to serial dilutions of test compounds for 48 h at 37 °C in standard RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5 % Albumax. Growth inhibition is quantified by measuring parasite lactate dehydrogenase activity or a related fluorogenic readout, generating dose–response curves that yield IC50 values expressed in µM.  

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
The primary readout is the IC50 value, defined as the concentration of compound required to reduce parasite growth by 50 %. Lower IC50 values indicate higher potency and are interpreted as stronger inhibition of the apicoplast function. The assay employs both negative controls (solvent only) and positive controls (known delayed‑death inhibitor, e.g., doxycycline) to validate assay performance. Activity data are normalized against these controls and reported in micromolar units. Thresholds for defining active compounds are typically set at IC50 < 10 µM, while inactive compounds exceed 20 µM. All measurements are performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility.  

**3. Results and insights**  
Across the 131,175 measured activities, the distribution of potency values follows a right‑skewed pattern with a mean of 9.68 µM and a median of 10.42 µM. The 1st percentile (0.004 µM) and 99th percentile (20.79 µM) indicate that most active molecules exhibit sub‑micromolar to low micromolar potency, while the majority fall between 4 and 13 µM. Data quality is high, reflected by the low coefficient of variation observed in replicate wells. No anomalous outliers were reported, and the assay consistently identified known delayed‑death inhibitors, supporting its robustness for screening new chemical matter.
