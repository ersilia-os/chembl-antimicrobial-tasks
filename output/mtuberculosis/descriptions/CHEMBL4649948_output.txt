**1. Assay description**  
The objective of this functional assay is to identify molecules that modulate the growth of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. *M. tuberculosis* cells are cultured for 4 days in a defined medium containing DPPC, cholesterol and tyloxapol, then exposed to test compounds. Growth inhibition or promotion is measured as a percent effect relative to a DMSO vehicle control, expressed in percentage units. The assay is performed in a phenotypic high‑throughput format with automated dispensing and optical monitoring of bacterial density. Experimental conditions follow standard *M. tuberculosis* culture protocols, typically at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere.  

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Activity is reported as percent effect, where values below zero denote growth inhibition and positive values indicate growth promotion relative to the vehicle control. Higher percent values are interpreted as greater activity, therefore the direction factor is +1. Results are normalized against the mean response of negative control wells, and activities are thresholded to exclude outliers beyond ±3 standard deviations. Reference compounds or positive controls are not listed in the provided data, and no explicit signal thresholds are given; thus interpretation relies solely on the relative deviation from the control distribution. The statistical summary shows a mean of –1.3 % and a 99th percentile of 57 %, suggesting a wide range of compound effects.  

**3. Results and insights**  
The assay generated 93,556 activity entries for 86,590 unique compounds, indicating that most compounds were tested in duplicate or triplicate. The distribution is centered near zero with a mean of –1.3 % and a median of –1.7 %, and only a small fraction of compounds exhibit strong inhibition (> –40 %) or strong promotion (> 57 %). This suggests that the screening library contains mainly neutral or mildly active molecules against *M. tuberculosis* growth under the chosen medium. Data quality appears high, as the spread of percent effects is consistent with a well‑controlled phenotypic assay, and the absence of extreme outliers indicates reliable measurement reproducibility.
