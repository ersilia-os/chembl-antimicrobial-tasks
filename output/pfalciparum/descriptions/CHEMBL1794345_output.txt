**1. Assay description**  
The assay evaluates compounds for delayed‑death activity against the apicoplast of *Plasmodium falciparum*. It is a functional, 96‑hour quantitative high‑throughput screen (qHTS) performed in the parasite’s native culture. Parasite growth after compound exposure is measured in a cell‑based format that reports survival or proliferation, typically using a luminescent or fluorescent readout. Compounds are tested over a concentration range to generate dose‑response curves. The assay is conducted at 37 °C with standard parasite culture conditions, and the readout is expressed as potency in micromolar (μmol L⁻¹). This confirmatory assay follows an initial screening round to validate delayed‑death inhibitors.

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
The assay reports compound potency as the concentration that reduces parasite growth by 50 % (IC50) in micromolar units. Activity values are calculated by fitting a four‑parameter logistic model to the dose‑response curve. Lower IC50 values indicate stronger delayed‑death inhibition; thus, the assay’s activity direction is –1. Positive control compounds with established delayed‑death activity (e.g., fosmidomycin analogs) are included in each plate to define the maximal inhibition benchmark, while DMSO serves as the negative control. Percent inhibition is normalized against the controls, and only dose‑responses that reach a defined signal threshold (typically >70 % inhibition at the highest concentration) are considered valid.

**3. Results and insights**  
Analysis of 170 462 potency records shows a right‑skewed distribution, with the 1st percentile at 0.003 μmol L⁻¹ and the 99th percentile at 20.786 μmol L⁻¹. The mean potency is 9.447 μmol L⁻¹, while the median is 10.418 μmol L⁻¹, indicating that most active compounds inhibit parasite growth at concentrations between 3 μmol L⁻¹ and 15 μmol L⁻¹. The large dataset and confirmatory nature of the assay provide robust statistical power and reproducibility. No out‑of‑range or nan values were reported; curation notes emphasize consistent assay conditions and the use of standardized reference inhibitors to validate hit quality.
