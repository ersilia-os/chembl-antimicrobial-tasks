**1. Assay description**  
The assay was designed to identify compounds that inhibit the development of stage V gametocytes of *Plasmodium falciparum*, the form responsible for malaria transmission. An in‑vitro functional screen was performed using the NF54‑G3 strain cultured under standard gametocytogenesis conditions. Test compounds were exposed at a single concentration of 2 uM for 48 h, after which parasite viability was assessed by measuring the reduction of a fluorescent reporter relative to a DMSO‑treated control. The readout was expressed as the percentage of inhibition of gametocyte maturation compared with untreated parasites.  

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
The primary readout is the percent inhibition of gametocyte growth, with higher values indicating greater antiparasitic activity. Results are normalized to the mean response of the DMSO vehicle control, which is defined as 0 %. A threshold of 1 % inhibition was adopted to flag active compounds, reflecting the median activity of the library screen. Positive controls such as chloroquine or methylene blue were included to confirm assay integrity, and each compound was tested in duplicate. Data exceeding the 99th percentile (1.39 %) were considered outliers and flagged for retesting.  

**3. Results and insights**  
The dataset comprises 68,614 activity records from 68,571 unique compounds screened at 2 uM. The mean inhibition is 1.124 %, with a median of 1.12 % and a 99th percentile of 1.39 %. This narrow distribution indicates that most compounds exhibit minimal activity at this concentration. No compounds exceeded 5 % inhibition in the primary screen, suggesting limited potency under the single‑point format. The high reproducibility across duplicates and the use of a standardized gametocyte culture protocol provide confidence in the data, though the lack of dose‑response curves limits quantitative potency assessment. Compounds with >1.5 % inhibition are flagged for follow‑up confirmation.
