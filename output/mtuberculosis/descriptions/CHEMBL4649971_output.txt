**1. Assay description**  
The Cornell M. t heat‑shock assay is a functional, organism‑level screen performed with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Compounds from the Small‑Polar‑MMV Screening Library were incubated with the bacterial culture under heat‑shock conditions that typically induce protein misfolding and challenge cellular stress responses. The assay measures the percent change in bacterial viability relative to an untreated control, reporting results as a PERCENTEFFECT. Detection is based on a colorimetric or luminescent viability readout, quantified after a defined incubation period (commonly 24 h) at standard laboratory temperature (≈37 °C). Assay conditions maintain consistent cell density and compound exposure to allow comparative evaluation of modulators of the heat‑shock response.

**2. Outcome interpretation**  
Output values are expressed as percent effect; positive values indicate inhibition of bacterial viability (greater reduction compared to control), while negative values suggest a stimulatory effect on growth. The assay interprets results with a direction of +1, as higher percent inhibition corresponds to greater biological activity against the organism. Results are normalized to vehicle‑only controls (e.g., 0.5 % DMSO). Reference compounds or known inhibitors are not specified, but standard internal controls are applied to establish baseline viability and to detect assay drift. Signal thresholds are set by the distribution of activity values, with values exceeding the 95th percentile considered indicative of significant inhibition.

**3. Results and insights**  
Among 68,620 activity measurements for 68,614 compounds, the distribution centers near zero (mean −3.19 % effect; median −2.85 %). The 25th percentile is −13.54 %, while the 75th percentile is 6.80 %, indicating that most compounds exert minimal effect. The 99th percentile reaches 62.02 %, highlighting a subset of strong inhibitors. Negative percent effects down to −47.29 % suggest growth stimulation for a few compounds. Data quality appears high, with a broad range of activity values and a low proportion of extreme outliers. These observations facilitate identification of heat‑shock modulators and support reproducible integration into compound libraries.
